# üèä Cafe-Data

This project is a Flask-based web application that showcases advanced **WTForms** features, including emoji-powered dropdowns, safe form handling, and CSV file writing. It's styled with **Bootstrap-Flask** to ensure clean UI integration.

## üöÄ Features Implemented

### üìã Form Fields with Emoji SelectFields

This app includes user-friendly form fields powered by emoji ratings:

* **Coffee Rating**: `‚òï` to `‚òï‚òï‚òï‚òï‚òï`
* **Wi-Fi Rating**: `‚úò` to `üí™üí™üí™üí™üí™`
* **Power Rating**: `‚úò` to `üîåüîåüîåüîåüîå`

Each dropdown uses the `SelectField` with a tuple structure like:

```python
('üí™üí™', 'üí™üí™')
```

This stores the first value and displays the second.

### üì® Form Handling and Submission

* Data is retrieved using `request.form.get('field_name')` for safety.
* Avoided using dot notation (e.g., `form.name.data`) to prevent common pitfalls.
* Renamed reserved keywords like `open` to `opening_time`.

---

### üìÖ CSV Writing

On successful form submission, cafe details are written to `cafe-data.csv`:

```python
with open('cafe-data.csv', mode='a', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow([name, location, opening_time, close, coffee, wifi, power])
```

Tips:

* `newline=''` avoids blank lines on Windows.
* Ensure the existing CSV ends with a newline to prevent misaligned rows.

---

### üåü Bootstrap-Enhanced UI

Used `render_form(form)` from Bootstrap-Flask for clean rendering:

```jinja
{% from 'bootstrap5/form.html' import render_form %}
{{ render_form(form) }}
```

Potential enhancements:

* Add success flash messages
* Redirect to cafe list or home page
* Display submitted data in real-time
